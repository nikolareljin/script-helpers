# SCRIPT: prune_branches.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Remove branches whose work has already landed, and only those.
# USAGE: scripts/prune_branches.sh [--apply] [--remote] [OPTIONS]
# PARAMETERS:
#   --apply           Actually delete. Without it nothing is removed: the
#                     default is a report, because the failure mode of this
#                     script is losing work.
#   --remote          Also consider branches on the remote. Local only by
#                     default -- a local branch is recoverable from the reflog
#                     for weeks; a deleted remote branch is not.
#   --repo <path>     Repository to operate on (default: current directory).
#   --base <branch>   Branch that work merges into (default: the remote's HEAD,
#                     then main/master/trunk/develop).
#   --remote-name <n> Remote to use (default: origin).
#   --keep <pattern>  Never touch branches matching this glob. Repeatable.
#   --no-fetch        Skip the fetch. Faster, and wrong if the remote moved:
#                     a stale base makes a landed branch look unmerged.
#   -h, --help        Show this help message.
# EXAMPLE: bash scripts/script-helpers/scripts/prune_branches.sh --remote --apply
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# `git branch --merged` is not enough on its own. It asks whether the branch
# tip is an ancestor of the base, which is true after a merge commit and false
# after every squash merge and every rebase merge. Repositories that squash --
# most of them -- accumulate branches it will never list.
#
# The dangerous direction is the other one. A branch whose work landed and
# which then received new commits still has something to lose, and a check that
# only asks "are these changes in the base?" deletes it. That case is real: a
# push to a branch whose pull request has already merged succeeds silently, and
# the commit sits somewhere no pull request will ever pick it up.
#
# So both tests here look at the branch tip as it stands now. A commit added
# after the merge changes the tip, which changes the tree, which fails both
# tests -- the protection falls out of the check rather than being a separate
# rule someone has to remember to write.
#
# What is never touched, whatever its merge state: the base branch, the branch
# currently checked out, a branch checked out in another worktree, anything
# matching a protected name (main, master, trunk, develop, production,
# release/*, hotfix/*), and any branch holding commits its upstream does not.

# names -- so an un-normalised `origin/main` matches no local branch, the base
# stops being recognised as the base, and it classifies as merged against
# itself. That is the bug this guard exists to prevent, arriving through the
# flag instead.
