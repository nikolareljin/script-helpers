# SCRIPT: check_private_names.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Fail when the name of a private repository appears in text that is about to become public.
# USAGE: scripts/check_private_names.sh [--tree|--commits <range>|--file <path>|--stdin] [--list <path>] [--names <a,b>] [--repo <path>] [--only-public] [--for-repo <name>] [--strict-ambiguous] [-h]
# PARAMETERS:
#   --tree              Scan tracked files (the default when nothing else is given).
#   --commits <range>   Scan commit messages in a range, e.g. origin/main..HEAD.
#   --file <path>       Scan a file — a pull request or issue body written out before posting.
#   --stdin             Scan standard input.
#   --list <path>       Name list to use. Overrides PRIVATE_NAMES_FILE and the cache.
#   --names <a,b>       Comma-separated names, instead of a list file. For tests.
#   --repo <path>       Repository to scan (default: cwd).
#   --only-public       Do nothing unless this repository is public, per the list.
#   --for-repo <name>   Judge visibility by this repository name, not the git remote.
#   --strict-ambiguous  Fail on a bare everyday-word name too, rather than warning, and
#                       check the tree for one as well. For text about to be posted
#                       publicly, where nobody will re-read it afterwards.
#   -h, --help          Show this help message.
# EXIT_CODES:
#   0  no private name found
#   1  a private name was found
#   2  could not check (no list, an empty list, not a repository)
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# A public repository must never contain the name of a private one -- not in its
# tree, and not in the text that lands around it on the forge: commit messages,
# pull request titles and bodies, issue text, review replies.
#
# Why a gate rather than a rule people remember: this rule was written down, in
# capitals, and was broken anyway. And unlike most mistakes it cannot be undone.
# GitHub keeps the edit history of every pull request and issue body publicly, so
# editing the body afterwards leaves the original a click away; rewriting the
# commits changes every tag that points at them. The only version of this fix
# that works is the one that happens before the push.
#
# Matching is `grep -iF` -- fixed strings, case-insensitive, and deliberately
# NOT `-w`. A hyphen is a word boundary, so `-w` would miss the name inside a
# longer path, a possessive or a compound, which is exactly how a name travels
# in real text. A filter that cannot see its own subject is the failure mode
# this whole gate exists to prevent.
#
# TWO PATTERNS, because one cannot work. Some repository names are also ordinary
# English words. Run the plain check over a public tree and every occurrence of
# that word in ordinary prose is a hit; measured on two real repositories that
# was 28 matches across 18 files, all innocent. A gate that fires on every push
# gets uninstalled within the week.
#
# The first version of this script answered that by not checking those names in
# the tree at all. That was wrong, and wrong in the direction that matters: the
# hole it left swallowed a real leak -- a path naming a private repository,
# written into this very file, which the gate then declared the tree clean of.
# An exemption you cannot see is not a quieter gate, it is a blind one.
#
# So every name is checked everywhere, and what differs is the pattern:
#
#   - an ordinary name matches as a fixed substring, so it is caught inside a
#     longer path, a possessive or a compound;
#   - a name flagged `ambiguous` must appear as a whole token -- not preceded or
#     followed by a letter or digit. "beaconed" and "unbeaconed" stop matching;
#     "beacon", "beacon/", "owner/beacon" and "<beacon>/path" still do.
#
# Measured on the same two repositories that leaves 8 matches instead of 28, all
# of them the English word, and one line in .git/private-names-allow silences
# them per repository -- visibly, and without a hole anyone can forget about.
#
# THE OVERRIDE. The check will sometimes be wrong -- that is a certainty, not a
# risk, given the dictionary words above. Three ways past it, loudest last:
#
#   PRIVATE_NAMES_ALLOW="term,term"   allow named terms for this run
#   .git/private-names-allow          one term per line, for a repository where
#                                     a word recurs innocently (inside .git, so
#                                     it can never be committed anywhere)
#   <cache>/private-names-allow       the same, for every repository on this
#                                     machine, beside the name list
#   git push --no-verify              git's own escape, for a human
#
# Allowed terms are echoed, so an override is visible in the output rather than
# silently shrinking what was checked.
#
# The list is data, generated elsewhere and never committed to a public
# repository. See --help output above for where it is read from.

# ---- the search -----------------------------------------------------------
# grep's exit codes are load-bearing: 0 matched, 1 no match (the good case),
# 2+ it failed. Collapsing them with `|| true` is how a gate stops checking
# without anyone noticing.
# Two stages, and both are necessary.
#
# Stage one is a fixed-string filter, which is fast even with thousands of names: measured
# on a real dictionary of 1,488, `grep -F` over one repository takes 0.58s and yields 86
# candidate lines. Stage two applies the real rule to those candidates only.
#
# The alternative -- one `grep -E` with a boundary-anchored pattern per name -- gives the
# same answers and took over TWO MINUTES on the same repository, because the cost is
# compiling 1,488 regexes, not scanning. A check that slow is one people remove.
#
# Stage two is awk with index() and a character test, so nothing is compiled at all.
