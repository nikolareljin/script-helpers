# SCRIPT: ci_laravel.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Run a Laravel application's tests, in CI or on a laptop, with the database in Docker.
# USAGE: scripts/ci_laravel.sh [options]
# PARAMETERS:
#   --workdir <path>              Application directory (default: .).
#   --db-connection <name>        sqlite | mysql | pgsql (default: sqlite).
#   --db-image <image>            Start this database in Docker and use it. Implies a
#                                 server connection; the image name decides mysql or pgsql
#                                 unless --db-connection says otherwise.
#   --db-host <host>              Database host when one is not started (default: 127.0.0.1).
#   --db-port <port>              Host port for a started database (default: 3306 / 5432).
#   --db-name <name>              Database name (default: laravel).
#   --db-user <user>              Database user (default: laravel).
#   --db-password <password>      Database password (default: laravel).
#   --db-wait-seconds <n>         How long to wait for it to answer (default: 60).
#   --install-command <command>   Dependency install. Empty skips it
#                                 (default: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist).
#   --migrate-command <command>   Schema. Empty skips it (default: php artisan migrate --force).
#   --test-command <command>      The tests (default: php artisan test).
#   --env-file <path>             Environment file to copy to .env. Empty picks
#                                 .env.testing, then .env.example, when .env is absent.
#   --php-image <image>           Run everything in this image instead of on the host.
#                                 The image must have bash.
#   --docker-user <user>          User for that image, as uid:gid (default: the invoking user).
#   -h, --help                    Show this help message.
# EXIT_CODES:
#   0  The tests passed.
#   1  A step failed; its own exit code is used where there is one.
#   2  Bad arguments, or a combination that cannot work.
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Laravel's test suite needs three things a generic PHP runner does not provide:
# a .env, an APP_KEY in it, and a database its config can reach. Without the key
# every test fails with "No application encryption key has been specified", which
# says nothing about the real problem -- that nobody ran `artisan key:generate`.
#
# sqlite is the default because it needs no infrastructure and is what most
# Laravel suites already use. `--db-image` swaps in a real server for the suites
# that need one, and the same command then runs in CI and on a laptop.
