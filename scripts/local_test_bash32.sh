# SCRIPT: local_test_bash32.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Run the test suite under bash 3.2, the shell macOS ships.
# USAGE: bash scripts/local_test_bash32.sh [--test <file>] [--shell]
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   --test    Run a single test file instead of the whole suite.
#   --shell   Drop into an interactive bash 3.2 shell in the container.
#
# EXIT_CODES:
#   0  every test passed under bash 3.2
#   1  a test failed
#   3  docker is unavailable
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# macOS ships bash 3.2 as /bin/bash and, for licensing reasons, always will.
# Nothing about that shell is exotic -- it simply lacks mapfile, associative
# arrays and namerefs, and it fails at *runtime* rather than when a file is
# sourced. That is what made the breakage invisible: sourcing looked fine and
# the wrong answer appeared later.
#
# Running the real suite against a real 3.2 is the cheapest honest check, and it
# needs no Mac. The macOS CI job covers what this cannot: the BSD userland.
