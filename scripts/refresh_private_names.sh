# SCRIPT: refresh_private_names.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Build the private-repository name list that check_private_names.sh reads, from your own GitHub account or organisation.
# USAGE: scripts/refresh_private_names.sh [--owner <user-or-org>] [--out <path>] [--stdout] [--check] [--force] [--codes <path>] [--limit <n>] [--ttl <days>] [-h]
# PARAMETERS:
#   --owner <name>  Limit to this user or organisation; repeatable. Default: every
#                   account this token can see (you, plus your organisations).
#   --out <path>    Where to write. Default: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/script-helpers/private-names.tsv
#   --stdout        Print the list instead of writing it.
#   --check         Compare the written list with GitHub; change nothing.
#   --force         Write even if it would drop names or codes.
#   --limit <n>     Repositories to ask gh for per owner (default 8000).
#   --ttl <days>    Refetch an owner whose cache is older than this. Default: 1 day
#                   for your own account, 14 for an organisation.
#   --cache-dir <d> Where the per-owner caches live.
#   --no-graphql    Use `gh repo list` instead of the GraphQL query.
#   --codes <path>  Two columns, `name<TAB>code`, used to fill the code column that
#                   `gh repo list` cannot supply. Default:
#                   ~/.config/script-helpers/private-names-codes.tsv
#   -h, --help      Show this help message.
# ENVIRONMENT:
#   PRIVATE_NAMES_NEVER_AMBIGUOUS       Names to match bare even though they are dictionary
#                                       words. Comma or newline separated.
#   PRIVATE_NAMES_NEVER_AMBIGUOUS_FILE  A file of the same, one per line, comments allowed.
#                                       Default: ~/.config/script-helpers/private-names-unambiguous
# EXIT_CODES:
#   0  written (or, with --check, unchanged)
#   1  --check found the list out of date
#   2  bad arguments, or the account has no private repositories
#   3  gh is missing or not authenticated
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# check_private_names.sh refuses text that names a private repository, and it
# needs to know which names those are. That list is yours: your account, your
# organisation, your repositories. Nothing about it is shared, and nothing about
# it can be committed -- a file listing your private repositories is exactly the
# thing the gate exists to keep out of public trees.
#
# So it lives outside every working tree, at
# ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/script-helpers/private-names.tsv, one file per
# machine serving every repository on it.
#
# WHY THE NETWORK IS HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. This script talks to GitHub; the
# gate never does. A check that made a network call would add a round trip to
# every commit and every push, to catch an event -- a repository being created,
# or changing visibility -- that happens a few times a month and that you
# perform deliberately. Refresh after one of those, or on a cadence of days.
#
# AMBIGUOUS NAMES. A repository whose name is also an ordinary word is flagged,
# and the gate then requires it to appear as a whole token rather than as a
# substring, so an everyday use of the word in prose stops matching while
# "owner/<name>" still does. The flag comes from the system word list when there is one.
#
# The `code` column is for citing a private repository in public text without
# naming it. If you have no such scheme it stays `-`, and the gate simply says
# which name it found.
