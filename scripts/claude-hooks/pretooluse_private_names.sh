# SCRIPT: pretooluse_private_names.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Claude Code PreToolUse hook — stop an agent publishing text that names a private repository.
# USAGE: wired into a Claude Code settings.json PreToolUse hook for the Bash tool; reads the hook payload on stdin.
# EXIT_CODES:
#   0  the call may proceed
#   2  the call is blocked; the reason on stderr goes back to the agent
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# The git hooks in scripts/git-hooks/ cover the tree and commit messages. They
# cannot cover the surface where this actually went wrong: a pull request body
# and an issue body never touch git, so `gh pr create --body ...` publishes text
# no git hook will ever see. This runs before the tool call does.
#
# Only the text being published is checked -- the title, body and message
# arguments -- not the whole command line. `gh pr create --repo <private-repo>`
# is legitimate when the pull request belongs to that private repository, and a
# gate that blocked it would be turned off within a day.
#
# It also refuses --no-verify on commit and push. An agent has no legitimate
# reason to skip a local gate, and without this the git hooks are advisory for
# the one actor they were written for. A human at a terminal is unaffected:
# this hook only ever sees an agent's calls.
#
# INSTALL: in the settings.json Claude Code reads for the directory,
#
#   "hooks": { "PreToolUse": [ { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
#     "command": "bash <path>/script-helpers/scripts/claude-hooks/pretooluse_private_names.sh" } ] } ] }
