# SCRIPT: adb_wireless_test.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Tests for lib/adb.sh wireless helpers and scripts/check_no_private_ips.sh.
# USAGE: ./tests/adb_wireless_test.sh
# PARAMETERS: No required parameters.
# EXAMPLE: bash tests/adb_wireless_test.sh
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# `adb` is stubbed as a shell function, so these run with no device attached.
#
# The behaviours worth pinning without hardware are the ones where the obvious
# implementation is wrong: `adb connect` reporting success on a bare TCP
# handshake, an "offline" entry counting as attached, and an env-file writer
# that discards the keys it was not asked about.
# ----------------------------------------------------
# The `adb` stubs below are called only indirectly, by the library functions
# under test, so shellcheck reads every branch of them as unreachable. Must sit
# above the first command to apply file-wide.
# shellcheck disable=SC2317
