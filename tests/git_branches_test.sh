# SCRIPT: git_branches_test.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Tests for lib/git_branches.sh and scripts/prune_branches.sh.
# USAGE: ./tests/git_branches_test.sh
# PARAMETERS: No required parameters.
# EXAMPLE: bash tests/git_branches_test.sh
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# The case worth writing a fixture for is case 3: a branch that was
# squash-merged and then received another commit. Every other case is a branch
# that is obviously safe or obviously not; that one looks safe to any check
# that asks "are these changes in the base?" and is not.

#
# It is passed rather than required because the previous version skipped when
# the environment had no identity -- and CI has none, so every fixture check
# below, including the base-branch regression, never ran there while the run
# reported success. A check that reads as a pass when it did not execute is
# worse than no check.
