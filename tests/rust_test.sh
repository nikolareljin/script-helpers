# SCRIPT: rust_test.sh
# DESCRIPTION: Tests for lib/rust.sh -- resolving the Rust toolchain CI uses rather than PATH's first cargo.
# USAGE: ./tests/rust_test.sh
# PARAMETERS: No required parameters.
# EXAMPLE: bash tests/rust_test.sh
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# rustup and both cargos are stubs in a temporary directory. Nothing here
# installs a toolchain, reaches the network, or compiles anything.
#
# The behaviour worth pinning is the one that looks fine until it does not: a
# gate claiming "this is what CI would have run" while running an older
# distribution cargo. Its symptom is a lockfile error, so the failure points
# away from the cause.
# ----------------------------------------------------
