This project uses Keep a Changelog style and aims to follow Semantic Versioning for tagged releases.

## [Unreleased]

- Added: `CHANGELOG.md` to document notable changes going forward.
- Removed: `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` file removed from the working tree and purged from Git history.
- Maintenance: Rewrote Git history to eliminate `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` across branches; created safety backup branch `backup/remove-release-checklist-pre-rewrite` before rewriting.
