# ios

A general toolkit for **inspecting iOS devices and simulators and installing
builds** — the iOS counterpart to the [`adb`](./adb.md) module. List attached
devices and available simulators, boot/shut down simulators, install `.app`/`.ipa`
artifacts, launch apps, and build a release app or IPA with Flutter.

**macOS only.** Every function requires Apple's command-line tools (`xcrun`,
`simctl`, `xctrace`), which exist only on macOS with Xcode installed. On any
other host each function returns non-zero without stdout output, so callers
degrade cleanly. Prerequisite errors may still be written to stderr.

Provided as Bash (`lib/ios.sh`). A CI/build runner lives at `scripts/ci_ios.sh`.

CI runner
---------

Run `scripts/ci_ios.sh [--workdir <path>] [--skip-analyze] [--skip-test]
[--skip-build] [--export-plist <path>]` on a macOS host with Xcode and Flutter.
The export plist path is relative to `--workdir`. The runner exits `3` when the
Apple toolchain is unavailable, `1` for invalid arguments or a missing Flutter
executable, and otherwise propagates failures from Flutter build/test commands.

Requirements
------------

- macOS with Xcode and the command-line tools (`xcrun`, `simctl`).
- `flutter` on `PATH` for `ios_build_release`.

Functions
---------

### `ios_available`

Checks for macOS and `xcrun`. It takes no arguments and returns `0` when the
Apple command-line tools are available, otherwise `1`. It produces no output.

### `ios_list_devices`

Lists attached physical iPhones and iPads as `<name> (<udid>)`, one per line.
It takes no arguments, requires `xcrun xctrace`, and returns the command status.
An empty device list is a successful empty result.

### `ios_list_simulators`

Lists available simulators as `<name> (<udid>) (<state>)`. It takes no arguments,
requires `xcrun simctl`, and returns the command status. An empty list succeeds.

### `ios_booted_simulators`

Prints one UDID per booted simulator. It takes no arguments, requires `xcrun
simctl`, and returns the command status. No booted simulators is a successful
empty result.

### `ios_boot_simulator <udid|name>`

Boots the named simulator or UDID. It returns `0` when already booted or after a
successful boot, and non-zero for missing arguments or `simctl` failures.

### `ios_shutdown_simulators`

Shuts down all booted simulators using `xcrun simctl shutdown all`. It takes no
arguments and propagates the `simctl` exit status.

### `ios_install <udid> <path.app|path.ipa>`

Installs an `.app` on a booted simulator using `simctl`, or an `.ipa` on an
attached physical device using `devicectl`. IPA installation requires Xcode 15
or newer. Missing arguments/artifacts and unavailable `devicectl` return `1`;
tool installation failures are propagated.

### `ios_launch <udid> <bundle_id>`

Launches an installed simulator app using `xcrun simctl launch`. Missing
arguments return `1`; otherwise the `simctl` status is returned.

### `ios_build_release <flutter_project_dir> [export_options_plist]`

Runs `flutter pub get`, then builds a signed IPA when an export-options plist is
provided, or an unsigned iOS app otherwise. The optional plist is resolved
relative to the project directory. It requires Flutter, macOS, and Xcode and
returns non-zero for missing prerequisites, paths, or failed Flutter commands.

Example
-------

```bash
source helpers.sh
shlib_import ios

ios_available || { echo "not on macOS"; exit 0; }
ios_list_simulators
ios_boot_simulator "iPhone 15"
ios_build_release ./mobile ios/ExportOptions.plist
```
