# About

I build small, sharp tools: CI plumbing, shell libraries, device and hardware
utilities, and local-first AI. Everything listed here is public.

!!! tip "Companion library"
    **script-helpers** is the Bash side; [**ci-helpers**](https://nikolareljin.github.io/ci-helpers/)
    is the GitHub Actions side. ci-helpers vendors this library for its own
    scripting, and the two share one documentation system — if you are writing
    the scripts that CI runs, you probably want both.

## CI, release and repository tooling
