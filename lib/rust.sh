# Rust toolchain resolution: run a gate against the toolchain CI uses, not
# whatever PATH happens to offer first.
#
# CI installs Rust with dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable, which is rustup's
# stable. A workstation frequently also has a distribution cargo, and on many
# distributions it comes first on PATH and is years older. The failure that
# produces does not look like a toolchain problem:
#
#     error: lock file version 4 requires `-Znext-lockfile-bump`
#     error: failed to download `time-core v0.1.9`
#     feature `edition2024` is required
#
# Both read as a broken lockfile. A gate that claims "this is what CI would
# have run" while running a different compiler is worse than no gate, which is
# ADR-0027 rule 5 in the fleet that produced this library.
#
# Written for bash 3.2: no namerefs, no associative arrays, no ${var,,}.

# Usage: rust_toolchain_ci_uses [toolchain]
#
# Puts the named rustup toolchain's cargo first on PATH and exports it. The
# toolchain defaults to RUST_TOOLCHAIN, then "stable" -- the channel CI's
# dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable installs. It is named on purpose: a bare
# `rustup which cargo` follows the developer's default or a directory
# override, which may be nightly, and that reintroduces the gap this exists
# to close from the other side.
#
# Says so when the result differs from what PATH offered, because a silent
# switch is its own surprise. Returns non-zero, with an actionable message,
# when rustup cannot supply that toolchain.
