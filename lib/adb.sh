# adb / Android device utilities — a general toolkit for inspecting and debugging
# Android devices over USB via the Android Debug Bridge (`adb`).
#
# Everything is MULTI-DEVICE SAFE: functions target a device with
# `adb -s <serial>` rather than a bare `adb shell`, which errors with "more than
# one device" once a second device is attached. All functions return non-zero /
# no-op when `adb` is missing, so callers degrade cleanly.

# --- discovery -------------------------------------------------------------

# Usage: adb_available; returns 0 if the adb CLI is on PATH.
adb_available() { command -v adb >/dev/null 2>&1; }

# Usage: adb_ready_serials; prints the serial of each *ready* device, one per
# line, skipping the header and any offline/unauthorized entries (state column
# must be exactly "device"). Prints nothing when none are ready.

# Usage: adb_device_ip <serial> [iface=wlan0]; prints the device's IPv4 on the

# `pm list packages` fails with "SecurityException: Shell does not have

# --- wireless (adb over Wi-Fi) ---------------------------------------------
#
# A phone on the desk is not always a phone on a cable. These wrap the parts of
# `adb connect` that are easy to get wrong:
#
#  - tcpip mode is LOST ON REBOOT, and the failure looks identical to a wrong
#    address, so the recovery (one USB cable, once) has to be spelled out;
#  - Android 11+ "Wireless debugging" allocates a RANDOM port per session, so a
#    hard-coded 5555 silently stops working;
#  - the device's address belongs in a gitignored env file, never in a tracked
#    one — see `check_no_private_ips` in scripts/.
#
# Address is taken from ANDROID_DEVICE_IP / ANDROID_DEVICE_PORT, which
# `load_env` (lib/env.sh) puts in scope from a project's .env.

# Usage: adb_wireless_addr; prints "ip:port" from the environment, or returns
# non-zero when nothing is configured.
#
# DEV_DEVICE first: that is the dev-cli convention (templates/dev-cli) for
# "which device", it is what --device sets, and for a wireless device the device
# id IS "ip:port". One variable rather than two spellings of the same fact.
#
# A DEV_DEVICE holding a USB serial is correctly ignored here — a serial has no
# colon, so it is not something to `adb connect`, and the split form below (or
# nothing) applies instead.

# ANDROID_DEVICE_IP / ANDROID_DEVICE_PORT remain supported as an explicit split
