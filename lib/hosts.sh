  # reject -- it simply never matches -- so on macOS this always concluded
  # "absent" and appended a duplicate line on every single call. And a domain
  # interpolated into a regex brings its own dots with it, where "." matches any
  # character: "demo.local" would then be found in a file that only holds
  # "demoXlocal", and the entry would silently never be added.
